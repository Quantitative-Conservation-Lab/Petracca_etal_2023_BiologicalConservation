This repo details how to run the spatially-explicit projection model
submitted to Journal of Animal Ecology by Petracca et al. 

The “scripts” section has three codes (described in a_DESCRIPTION.txt) –
one to run the IPM for the data collection period (2009-2020) and two
different versions of the projection model for the years 2020-2070. The
latter scripts differ based on chosen territory selection method.

The “data” section has all data (in .Rdata formatting) needed to run all
models. See a_DESCRIPTION.txt for more.

The “function” section has functions related to the individual-based
movement model. These functions allow for attraction of lone wolves,
lethal removals, and dispersal of wolves depending on chosen territory
selection method. See a_DESCRIPTION.txt for more.
